/**
 * Where the pack assets live, derived from the module's own URL.
 *
 * The derived URL is only valid while `dist/index.js` is served from its published
 * location — an unbundled bare-ESM host, or a CDN that mirrors the package
 * directory verbatim. A bundler (Vite, Webpack, …) relocates this module into its
 * own output (`node_modules/.vite/deps/…`, `_astro/<hash>.js`), where the derived
 * `<dir>/mascot_pack` does not exist, so every pack request 404s. That is the case
 * `configure({ assets })` exists for: bundled hosts copy `dist/mascot_pack/` into
 * their static root (usually `/mascot_pack`, i.e. `DEFAULT_PACK_BASE_URL`) and
 * point the engine at it.
 *
 * The build layout this is derived from (see `vite.config.ts`):
 *
 *     dist/index.js            ← entry
 *     dist/chunks/<name>.js    ← this module, when code-split
 *     dist/mascot_pack/Neuron/...  ← the assets
 *
 * so the package root is `<entry>/../` from an entry chunk and `<chunk>/../../`
 * from a split chunk. Rooting at the *directory* rather than reconstructing the
 * file name keeps working when the entry keeps its published directory depth, is
 * renamed, or is hashed — only the depth is assumed. Moving the module into a
 * different directory (which is what a bundler does) invalidates the result.
